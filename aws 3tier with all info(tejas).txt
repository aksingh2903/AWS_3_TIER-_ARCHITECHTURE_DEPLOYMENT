AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Description: Sample 3-tier application template

Parameters:
  VpcId:
    Type: AWS::EC2::VPC::Id
    Description: VPC ID where the resources will be created
  SubnetIds:
    Type: List<AWS::EC2::Subnet::Id>
    Description: List of subnet IDs where the resources will be created

Resources:
  # Creating a security group for the application tier
  AppSecurityGroup:
    Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup
    Properties:
      GroupDescription: Security group for the application tier
      VpcId: !Ref VpcId
      SecurityGroupIngress:
        - IpProtocol: tcp
          FromPort: 80
          ToPort: 80
          CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0

  # Creating a security group for the database tier
  DbSecurityGroup:
    Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup
    Properties:
      GroupDescription: Security group for the database tier
      VpcId: !Ref VpcId
      SecurityGroupIngress:
        - IpProtocol: tcp
          FromPort: 3306
          ToPort: 3306
          SourceSecurityGroupId: !Ref AppSecurityGroup

  # Creating an EC2 instance for the web server tier
  WebServerInstance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      InstanceType: t2.micro
      ImageId: ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0
      SecurityGroupIds:
        - !Ref AppSecurityGroup
      SubnetId: !Select [0, !Ref SubnetIds]

  # Creating an RDS instance for the database tier
  DatabaseInstance:
    Type: AWS::RDS::DBInstance
    Properties:
      DBInstanceClass: db.t2.micro
      Engine: mysql
      MasterUsername: admin
      MasterUserPassword: adminpassword
      AllocatedStorage: '20'

      VPCSecurityGroups:
        - !Ref DbSecurityGroup

Outputs:
  WebsiteURL:
    Description: URL of the website
    Value: !Join ['', ['http://', !GetAtt [WebServerInstance, PublicDnsName]]]
  DatabaseEndpoint:
    Description: Endpoint of the database
    Value: !GetAtt [DatabaseInstance, Endpoint.Address]
In this template, we are creating a security group for the application tier and another security group for the database tier. We are then creating an EC2 instance for the web server tier and an RDS instance for the database tier. Finally, we are outputting the URL of the website and the endpoint of the database.

You can launch this CloudFormation stack in the AWS Management Console by selecting "Create Stack" and uploading this template file






how to  monitor  CPU usage, storage, and RAM of the above template
To monitor the CPU usage, storage, and RAM of the resources created by the CloudFormation template, you can use Amazon CloudWatch. CloudWatch is a monitoring service provided by AWS that can be used to collect and track metrics, collect and monitor log files, and set alarms.

To enable monitoring of CPU usage, storage, and RAM, you can add the following resources to your CloudFormation template:

CloudWatch Logs Agent: You can install the CloudWatch Logs Agent on the EC2 instance to collect logs and metrics. The agent collects system-level metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, and disk space usage, and sends them to CloudWatch for storage and analysis.

CloudWatch Alarms: You can create CloudWatch alarms to monitor the metrics collected by the CloudWatch Logs Agent. You can set up alarms for specific thresholds for CPU usage, memory usage, and disk space usage.

Here's an example of how you can modify the CloudFormation template to enable CloudWatch monitoring:

how to create alarm for the above template if the cpu utilization rises above 85 percent and the alert should be given through email
To create a CloudWatch alarm that will send an email notification when the CPU utilization of the EC2 instance exceeds 85%, you can add the following resource to your CloudFormation template:

yaml
Copy code
# Creating a CloudWatch alarm for CPU utilization
CPUUtilizationAlarm:
  Type: "AWS::CloudWatch::Alarm"
  Properties:
    AlarmName: "CPUUtilizationAlarm"
    AlarmDescription: "Alarm for CPU utilization of EC2 instance"
    Namespace: "AWS/EC2"
    MetricName: "CPUUtilization"
    Dimensions:
      - Name: "InstanceId"
        Value: !Ref WebServerInstance
    Statistic: "Average"
    Period: "300"
    EvaluationPeriods: "1"
    Threshold: "85"
    ComparisonOperator: "GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold"
    AlarmActions:
      - !Ref SNSNotificationTopic
    OKActions:
      - !Ref SNSNotificationTopic

# Creating an SNS topic for notification
SNSNotificationTopic:
  Type: "AWS::SNS::Topic"
  Properties:
    DisplayName: "CPUUtilizationAlarm"
    Subscription:
      - Endpoint: "your_email_address"
        Protocol: "email"
In the above resource, we are creating a CloudWatch alarm named "CPUUtilizationAlarm" that monitors the "CPUUtilization" metric of the EC2 instance. The alarm is triggered when the CPU utilization exceeds 85% for a period of 300 seconds. The alarm action is set to send a notification to an SNS topic named "SNSNotificationTopic", which is also created in the same CloudFormation template. The SNS topic is configured to send email notifications to the specified email address.

Note that you need to replace "your_email_address" with the actual email address where you want to receive the notifications. Also, you need to set up the email subscription for the SNS topic to receive the notifications





aws cloudformation template to create a subnet with 3 instances where all will not have public ips
You can create a CloudFormation template to create a subnet with three instances where all instances will not have public IPs using the following code:

yaml
Copy code
Resources:
  VPC:
    Type: "AWS::EC2::VPC"
    Properties:
      CidrBlock: "10.0.0.0/16"
      EnableDnsSupport: true
      EnableDnsHostnames: true
      Tags:
        - Key: "Name"
          Value: "MyVPC"
  Subnet:
    Type: "AWS::EC2::Subnet"
    Properties:
      VpcId: !Ref VPC
      CidrBlock: "10.0.0.0/24"
      Tags:
        - Key: "Name"
          Value: "MySubnet"
  SecurityGroup:
    Type: "AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup"
    Properties:
      GroupDescription: "Security group for instances in MySubnet"
      VpcId: !Ref VPC
      SecurityGroupIngress:
        - IpProtocol: tcp
          FromPort: 22
          ToPort: 22
          CidrIp: "0.0.0.0/0"
  Instance1:
    Type: "AWS::EC2::Instance"
    Properties:
      ImageId: "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
      InstanceType: "t2.micro"
      KeyName: "my-key"
      SubnetId: !Ref Subnet
      SecurityGroupIds:
        - !Ref SecurityGroup
      PrivateIpAddress: "10.0.0.10"
  Instance2:
    Type: "AWS::EC2::Instance"
    Properties:
      ImageId: "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
      InstanceType: "t2.micro"
      KeyName: "my-key"
      SubnetId: !Ref Subnet
      SecurityGroupIds:
        - !Ref SecurityGroup
      PrivateIpAddress: "10.0.0.11"
  Instance3:
    Type: "AWS::EC2::Instance"
    Properties:
      ImageId: "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
      InstanceType: "t2.micro"
      KeyName: "my-key"
      SubnetId: !Ref Subnet
      SecurityGroupIds:
        - !Ref SecurityGroup
      PrivateIpAddress: "10.0.0.12"
In the above code, we create a VPC with CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16. We then create a subnet within the VPC with CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24. We also create a security group that allows inbound traffic on port 22 (SSH) from any IP address.

We then create three instances, each with a private IP address in the subnet. The instances are associated with the security group created earlier and do not have public IP addresses because we have not specified any Elastic IP or public IP addresses in the properties of the instances.

Note that you will need to replace the ImageId and KeyName properties with the appropriate values for your account and region. Also, you may need to adjust the private IP addresses to fit within the CIDR block of your subnet

This looks like a CloudFormation YAML or JSON template syntax where !Sub is a CloudFormation intrinsic function that substitutes variables in a string with their corresponding values.

${AWS::StackName} is a special variable that represents the name of the CloudFormation stack, which is the unique identifier of the stack that you specify when you create the stack.

Therefore, LaunchTemplateName: !Sub '${AWS::StackName}-launchTemplate4ASG' means that the LaunchTemplateName property is set to a string value that is generated by concatenating the stack name with the string "-launchTemplate4ASG". For example, if the stack name is "my-stack", then the resulting string value would be "my-stack-launchTemplate4ASG".

This approach allows you to create a unique name for your launch template that is based on the name of your CloudFormation stack, which can be useful when you want to create multiple stacks with the same or similar resources without having to manually specify unique names for each resource.
